# EPL Descriptive Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive descriptive analysis of the English Premier League (EPL) from its inception in 1992 up to the 2021/2022 season. The analysis is presented through an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore various aspects of the league, such as team performance, standings, and key statistics over the years.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from [data.world](https://data.world/evangower/premier-league-standings-1992-2022). It includes detailed standings and performance metrics for all teams that have competed in the EPL from the 1992/1993 season through to the 2021/2022 season.

### Dataset Features
- **Season:** The season in which the data was recorded.
